# README

Simple 1D double-well potential system for demonstrating the 
Weighted Ensemble method. 

Requires [WESTPA](https://chong.chem.pitt.edu/WESTPA) and all of its dependencies.
The easiest way to install all of the necessary requirements is using the Anaconda
Python distribution.

To generate the data and run the visualization you can use the included `Makefile`. 
```bash
make setup
make bruteforce
make we
make visualize
```
